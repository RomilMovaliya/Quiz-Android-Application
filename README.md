## Simple Quiz Application


## Overview


- <p>A simple and interactive quiz application built for Android, allowing users to test their knowledge on various topics through multiple-choice questions.</p>

- In this project, I utilized PHP for communication with a MySQL database. The development environment runs on my local machine, allowing for direct access to the database. Therefore, for the application to work, your Android device must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as my laptop.

- Alternatively, you can deploy the project on an AWS EC2 instance. This would provide you with a public IP address, enabling remote access to the application from any device, regardless of the local network.
